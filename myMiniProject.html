            <h1> About These Projects </h1>
            This webpage is a demonstration of simple yet powerful web applications designed to showcase 
            foundational skills in web development. It features three mini projects:
            the To-Do List App, the Photo Gallery, and the Counter App. Each project 
            serves a unique purpose and highlights key aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            <br><br>
            The To-Do List App helps users manage their tasks efficiently. It's interactive 
            and user-friendly, allowing tasks to be added dynamically. 
            The Photo Gallery is a visually appealing section that uses responsive 
            CSS Grid for layout management. It adapts beautifully across screen sizes. 
            Finally, the Counter App demonstrates the use of JavaScript for real-time 
            interactivity, enabling users to increment and decrement a number with the click of a button.
            <br><br>
            These projects are designed to be simple yet scalable, offering a perfect 
            starting point for anyone interested in learning web development. Explore 
            each section to learn more about these fun and functional applications.

      <h2>To-Do List App</h2>
      <p>
        The To-Do List App is a basic yet effective tool for managing daily tasks. 
        With an easy-to-use interface, it allows users to add tasks to a list dynamically. 
        The tasks are stored in an array, and a JavaScript function ensures that the 
        list is updated and displayed in real time. By iterating over the array, 
        the app provides a comprehensive overview of all tasks. This project emphasizes 
        the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and demonstrates the power of loops 
        and arrays in building interactive features.

    <section id="photo-gallery">
      <h2>Photo Gallery</h2>
      <p>
        The Photo Gallery showcases images in a clean and responsive grid layout. 
        Using CSS Grid, the gallery is designed to display images in three columns 
        on desktop screens, providing a visually appealing arrangement. On smaller 
        screens, the layout adapts to a single-column format, ensuring that the 
        gallery is accessible and user-friendly on all devices. This project demonstrates 
        the versatility of CSS Grid and media queries for creating adaptable web designs.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="counter-app">
      <h2>Counter App</h2>
      <p>
        The Counter App is a simple interactive application that allows users to 
        increment and decrement a number dynamically. Featuring two buttons and 
        a display area, this app showcases the use of JavaScript for event handling 
        and state management. By clicking the buttons, users can see real-time updates 
        to the counter value. This project is a great example of how JavaScript can 
        bring web pages to life, making them more engaging and functional for users.
