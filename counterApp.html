        <h2>What is Counter App</h2>
        <p>
            Connfair's people counter, the Counter App, digitally assists event organizers and location managers with capacity control. 
            An employee ticks each person who enters the controlled area and, with clear evaluation graphics, provides an overview of
             how many people are on the premises. It is suitable for events with multiple entrances and exits. 
             The Counter App automatically synchronizes different entrances via the Connfair cloud servers.
        </p>

          <h2>Here are some key facts about a counter app:</h2>

        <p>
           <br><strong>Functionality:</strong>nA counter app generally includes at least two buttons: one to increment the count and another to decrement it. The counter value is displayed in between.
            
           <br><strong>State Management:</strong> JavaScript is used to manage the state of the counter. It listens for events (such as button clicks) and updates the display accordingly.
            
           <br><strong>User Interface: </strong> The user interface is often simple, featuring a numeric display and buttons styled with CSS for better user interaction.
            
            <br><strong>Common Use: </strong> Counter apps are commonly used for counting events, tracking numbers, or keeping score in games.
            
            <br><strong>Interactivity: </strong>The app's interactive features typically rely on event listeners in JavaScript to detect user actions and update the app's display.</p>
